# PracTimer

PracTimer is a web-based Timer application that uses HTML5, CSS3
and Vanilla Javascript. 

# Controls

The application is controlled via `location.hash`, or the anchor tag
section of the URL. This is a way of getting data into the application
without needing a page reload.

It's also useful so that, should you have a certain time you want to
reuse, you can easily bookmark that time and reuse it.

The default time is 5 minutes, which is the time allotted for 
Lightning Talks.
